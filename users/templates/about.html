    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      Mixtape automatically creates a collaborative playlist using your own and any number of
      friends' music tastes and favorite songs smoothly blended together so that everyone can
      listen. Just link any assortment of playlists you want and Mixtape will shuffle through them
      all. Mixtape is perfect for providing group sessions with music that each member can enjoy
      listening to in the background. Mixtape has other uses too, like providing users with a new
      way to experiment with their music. Not everyone likes to jump right into a new genre, but
      Mixtape provides a new opportunity for users to choose how they can. The variety is dependent
      on the user as they can choose how many albums or playlists to pool together, so they can get
      a bit of everything or something more specific. Mixtape can pick and choose songs that are
      similar among playlists, which can allow users to discover songs close to their style. It can
      also choose songs at random for users to experiment listening to.
