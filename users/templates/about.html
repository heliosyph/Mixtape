    Mixtape automatically creates a collaborative playlist using your own and
    any number of friends' music tastes and favorite songs smoothly blended
    together so that everyone can listen. Just link any assortment of playlists
    you want and Mixtape will shuffle through them all. Mixtape is perfect for
    providing group sessions with music that each member can enjoy listening to
    in the background. Mixtape has other uses too, like providing users with a
    new way to experiment with their music. Not everyone likes to jump right
    into a new genre, but Mixtape provides a new opportunity for usersto choose
    how they can. The variety is dependent on the user as they can choose how
    many albums or playlists to pool together, so they can get a bit of
    everything or something more specific. Mixtape can pick and choose songs
    that are similar among playlists, which can allow users to discover songs
    close to their style. It can also choose songs at random for users to
    experiment listening to.
